# How to Play "Simon Says"

Simon Says is a memory-based game where a sequence of buttons lights up in a specific order, and you have to push the buttons in that order. The number of buttons lighting up increases by one with each round. The game includes an auto-run toggle that makes the game automatically progress to the next round if enabled. If the auto-run toggle is off, you must manually start the next round by pushing a button.

## How to Play
1. **Start Round**: Push a button to start the game or advance to the next round, depending on the auto-run toggle status.
2. **Observe Pattern**: Pay attention as the game displays a sequence of lit buttons. Memorize the order in which they light up.
3. **Reproduce Pattern**: After the sequence is shown, replicate the same sequence by pushing the buttons in the correct order.
4. **Auto-Run Toggle**: If enabled, the game will automatically progress to the next round after a correct sequence is entered. If disabled, you must manually start the next round by pushing a button.
   
## Tips
- Focus and concentration are key to remembering the sequence of lit buttons.
- Break down the sequence into smaller chunks to make it easier to remember.
- Practice regularly to improve your memory and reaction time.

Simon Says is an entertaining game to test and improve your memory and reflexes. Enjoy the challenge and see how far you can progress!
